# Better Iron Recycling

Recycle more iron items! With this data pack, you can recycle more iron-based items, such as chains, shields, rails and iron bars, in a furnace or blast furnace for nuggets or even ingots!

If something requires four or more ingots per item to make, get one ingot from smelting it. Otherwise, get an iron nugget. Exceptions: Compasses become iron nuggets and doors become iron ingots.
